        <p>Dovac is an application for the dematerialization of the files of temporary workers at the University of
            Franche-Comté. It is used to allow professionals to complete an administrative file in order to be able to
            intervene at the University as a temporary worker. On the administration side, the application allows the
            resource persons to manage all the files of temporary workers and to complete the hours they carry out.</p>

        <div class="contenuDescription">
            <p>This project was divided into two parts. The first part was carried out in groups of three. It consisted
                in analyzing Dovac's competition, and therefore doing a market study. Then, we had to create three typical
                personas, three imaginary people who would need to use Dovac. So we imagined two temporary workers and an
                administrator.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, during this part we made several experience maps, listed the features and finally, we
                designed a moodboard related to the application.
            </p>
            <p>
                Concerning the second part, it was done individually. During this time, we each developed a graphic model
                taking into account the user's path. The graphic model as well as the prototyping were realized with figma,
                a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool.
