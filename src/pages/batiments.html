        <p>The Güell Palace, our "mini-boss". The objective was to realize a communication file, a graphic model, as
            well as the prototyping, of a design and modern showcase site on an imposed theme: Antoni Gaudí, a Catalan
            architect of Spanish nationality and main representative of Catalan modernism, and one of his achievements,
            the Güell Palace. And all this in two weeks.

    <div class="contenuDescription">
        <p> In order to start the project, we researched articles about the artist, Antoni Gaudí, and his works. I took
            care of the list and descriptions of Antoni Gaudí's works inscribed in UNESCO. I also took care of the list
            of architects who received the Pritzker Prize.
        </p>

            For the visual identity of this project, we chose warm colors, to make the model warm. In addition, they
            remind us of the atmosphere of the Güell Palace, the colors of its windows. We placed many images to illustrate
            our content, and some images were retouched with photoshop. Without forgetting the logo, which I realized on
            Adobe Illustrator.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the typography of the titles, we used "Merriweather". This typography ensures an excellent visibility
            which adapts to all the supports, for mobile or computer for example. For the paragraphs, we chose "Roboto",
            because it is a simple typography, easy to read and very used on the web.
